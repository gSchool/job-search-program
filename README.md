### Action Items

1. Check out the [JSP Slack channel](https://hackreactorx.slack.com/archives/C01UR456F99) right now! We make most announcements in the Slack channel, including schedule updates, time-sensitive job opportunities, and event announcements. Can't view that channel? Make sure you accept your HRX workspace invitation (received in W12). Once you accept that invitation, make sure that you are logged into Slack using that account, and re-try the link.
